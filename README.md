## Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using machine learning techniques. 
The goal is to identify customers who are most likely to discontinue their service and uncover the key factors driving churn. 
By proactively addressing these drivers, telecom companies can enhance customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

🎯 Objectives

* Build a predictive model to classify customers as likely to churn or not.
* Analyze and identify top drivers contributing to churn.
* Provide business recommendations to reduce churn and improve satisfaction.
* Deliver a data-driven solution that supports targeted retention strategies.

🧾 Tech Stack

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Modeling Techniques: Classification, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization.

📊 Key Insights

🔹 Overall Churn Rate:
Approximately 18–22% of customers were found to be at churn risk.
🔹 Top 3 Churn Drivers:
* Short Tenure – New customers (<6 months) show 2.5× higher churn.
* Month-to-Month Plans – Flexible contracts have higher churn rates than annual/postpaid ones.
* High Complaint Volume / Unresolved Issues – Users with ≥3 unresolved complaints have ~40% higher churn odds.

💡 Business Recommendations
* Retention Campaigns: Offer personalized discounts to postpaid high-usage customers with frequent complaints.
* Contract Upgrades: Promote long-term plan conversions for month-to-month users.
* Complaint Management: Resolve open complaints within 48 hours.
* Predictive Alerts: Deploy dashboards highlighting high-risk regions and customers with ≥0.75 churn probability.
* Marketing Strategy: Introduce loyalty programs, OTT bundles, and auto-renewal options.
